# RECAST Frontend

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Ensure that RECAST's backend is working, and running on port 8000, for the client to communicate.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can run the newly built app with `yarn start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```
